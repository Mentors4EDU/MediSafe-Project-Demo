# MediSafe Project Demo (HackingHealth Windsor)

Did you know lots of your hospital data isn't that secure? For HIPPA standards we use the same style of AES256 & Blowfish encryption as in the 1990s. Using different Cisco frameworks & custom hardware, we can replace that with Cisco Type 7. Meaning a health care portal with more path walls and less vulnerable to hacking and data loss. We call our selves, "MediSafe".

## Getting Started

Right now we have a custom Admin/Authentication pannel created with Cisco Spark for Demo purposes. The API we are using, which judges can have access to are hosted on a private [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/gamer456148/medibot-simulation/downloads/) repository as well as some hardware code and different "demo servers".

## Built With

* [Trello API](http://api.trello.com/) - Dependency Management
* [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) - Hosting
* [Cisco Spark](ciscospark.com/) - The Portal SDK
* [Raspbian OS](http://pibakery.org/) Hardware OS for Demo Dev
